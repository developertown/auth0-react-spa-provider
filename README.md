# Auth0 React SPA Provider

This is a small library designed to make it easier to integrate the Auth0 SPA library
into React-based applications.

## Installation

```
$ yarn add @developertown/auth0-react-spa-provider
```

The library depends on a couple peer dependencies which you'll need to provide if the
consuming application does not have them already:

```
yarn add react react-use
```

## Usage
 TODO.
